For the final 16 years (1990–2005), the lake was fertilized with phosphorus alone. Reducing nitrogen inputs increasingly favored nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria as a response by the phytoplankton community to extreme seasonal nitrogen limitation. Nitrogen fixation was sufficient to allow biomass to continue to be produced in proportion to phosphorus, and the lake remained highly eutrophic, despite showing indications of extreme nitrogen limitation seasonally. To reduce eutrophication, the focus of management must be on decreasing inputs of phosphorus.},

	abstract = {Fingerprints of excitation spectra of chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence can be used to differentiate `spectral groups' of microalgae in vivo and in situ in, for example, vertical profiles within a few seconds. The investigated spectral groups of algae (green group, Chlorophyta; blue, Cyanobacteria; brown, Heterokontophyta, Haptophyta, Dinophyta; mixed, Cryptophyta) are each characterised by a specific composition of photosynthetic antenna pigments and, consequently, by a specific excitation spectrum of the Chl fluorescence. Particularly relevant are Chl a, Chl c, phycocyanobilin, phycoerythrobilin, fucoxanthin and peridinin. A laboratory-based instrument and a submersible instrument were constructed containing light-emitting diodes to excite Chl fluorescence in five distinct wavelength ranges. Norm spectra were determined for the four spectral algal groups (several species per group). Using these norm spectra and the actual five-point excitation spectrum of a water sample, a separate estimate of the respective Chl concentration is rapidly obtained for each algal group. The results of dilution experiments are presented. In vivo and in situ measurements are compared with results obtained by HPLC analysis. Depth profiles of the distribution of spectral algal groups taken over a time period of few seconds are shown. The method for algae differentiation described here opens up new research areas, monitoring and supervision tasks related to photosynthetic primary production in aquatic environments.},

              Microcystis aeruginosa 
              , in western Lake Erie was characterized using a combination of satellite ocean‐color  imagery, field data, and meteorological observations. The bloom was first identified by satellite on 14 August 2008 and persisted for {\textgreater} 2 months. The distribution and intensity of the bloom was estimated using a satellite algorithm that is sensitive to near‐surface concentrations of 
              M. aeruginosa 
              . Increases in both area and intensity were most pronounced for wind stress {\textless} 0.05 Pa. Area increased while intensity did not change for wind stresses of 0.05‐0.1 Pa, and both decreased for wind stress {\textgreater} 0.1 Pa. The recovery in intensity at the surface after strong wind events indicated that high wind stress mixed the bloom through the water column and that it returned to the surface once mixing stopped. This interaction is consistent with the understanding of the buoyancy of these blooms. Cloud cover (reduced light) may have a weak influence on intensity during calm conditions. While water temperature remained {\textgreater} 15°C, the bloom intensified if there were calm conditions. For water temperature {\textless} 15°C, the bloom subsided under similar conditions. As a result, wind stress needs to be considered when interpreting satellite imagery of these blooms.},

However, a collection of field samples for extractive analysis in a laboratory may not fully represent the field conditions. Handheld fluorometers that can measure chlorophyll-a in situ are available, but their performance in waters with a variety of potential light-interfering substances has not yet been tested. We tested a handheld fluorometer for sensitivity to ambient light and turbidity and compared these findings with EPA Method 445.0 using water samples obtained from two urban lakes in Tucson, Arizona, USA. Our results suggested that the probe was not sensitive to ambient light and performed well at low chlorophyll-a concentrations ({\textless}25 µg/L) across a range of turbidity levels (50–70 NTU). However, the performance was lower when the chlorophyll-a concentrations were {\textgreater}25 µg/L and turbidity levels were {\textless}50 NTU. To account for this discrepancy, we developed a calibration equation to use for this handheld fluorometer when field monitoring for potential harmful algal blooms in water bodies.},

	abstract = {Historically, phosphorus (P) has been considered the primary limiting nutrient for phytoplankton assemblages in freshwater ecosystems. This review, supported by new findings from Lake Erie, highlights recent molecular, laboratory, and field evidence that the growth and toxicity of some non-diazotrophic blooms of cyanobacteria can be controlled by nitrogen (N). Cyanobacteria such as Microcystis possess physiological adaptations that allow them to dominate low-P surface waters, and in temperate lakes, cyanobacterial densities can be controlled by N availability. Beyond total cyanobacterial biomass, N loading has been shown to selectively promote the abundance of Microcystis and Planktothrix strains capable of synthesizing microcystins over strains that do not possess this ability. Among strains of cyanobacteria capable of synthesizing the N-rich microcystins, cellular toxin quotas have been found to depend upon exogenous N supplies. Herein, multi-year observations from western Lake Erie are presented demonstrating that microcystin concentrations peak in parallel with inorganic N, but not orthophosphate, concentrations and are significantly lower (p{\textless}0.01) during years of reduced inorganic nitrogen loading and concentrations. Collectively, this information underscores the importance of N as well as P in controlling toxic cyanobacteria blooms. Furthermore, it supports the premise that management actions to reduce P in the absence of concurrent restrictions on N loading may not effectively control the growth and/or toxicity of non-diazotrophic toxic cyanobacteria such as the cosmopolitan, toxin-producing genus, Microcystis.},

	abstract = {The toxin-producing, bloom-forming cyanobacterial genera Microcystis and Planktothrix require fixed nitrogen (N), such as nitrate, ammonium, or organic N (e.g., urea) for growth and production of microcystins (MC). Bioavailable N can enter lakes in pulses via tributary discharge and through in-lake recycling, which can maintain low N concentrations. Additionally, light intensity has been suggested to play a role in MC production. This study examined how three forms of N (nitrate, ammonium, and urea) interacted with N loading rate (one large pulse vs. many small pulses) and light intensity to stimulate Microcystis and Planktothrix growth and MC production using nutrient enrichment experiments. Enrichments of nitrate, ammonium, and urea resulted in greater cyanobacterial biovolumes and MC concentrations than phosphorus-only enrichments, and there was no difference between pulse (100mumol/L) and press treatments (8.3mumol/L every 4h). Analysis of mcyD transcripts showed significant up-regulation within 4h of ammonium and urea enrichment. High light intensities (300mumol photons/m(2)/s) with N enrichment resulted in greater cyanobacterial biovolumes and MC concentrations than lower light intensities (30 and 3mumol photons/m(2)/s). Overall, the results suggest Microcystis and Planktothrix can use many forms of N and that high light intensities enhance MC production during elevated N concentrations. Moreover, the results here further demonstrate the importance of considering N, as well as P, in management strategies aimed at mitigating cyanobacterial blooms.},
